    <strong>Talk Title: </strong>"Nature-Inspired Algorithms for Complex Optimization Problems" <br/><br/>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> Nature-inspired algorithms such as the particle swarm optimization, bat algorithm and firefly algorithm have been widely used to solve problems in complex optimization, data mining and computational intelligence. The number of nature-inspired algorithms has increased significantly in recent years. However, it lacks some in-depth mathematical analysis of these algorithms. This talk summarizes the latest developments, and provide some analysis of these algorithms. In addition, some challenges and open problems will also be highlighted.<br/><br/>
<strong>Brief Biography:</strong> Xin-She Yang obtained his DPhil in Applied Mathematics from the University of Oxford. He then worked at Cambridge University and National Physical Laboratory (UK) as a Senior Research Scientist. Now he is Reader at Middlesex University London, and a co-Editor of the Springer Tracts in Nature-Inspired Computing. He has published more than 250 peer-reviewed research papers with nearly 60,000 citations, and he has been on the prestigious list of highly-cited researchers (Clarivate Analytics/Web of Sciences) for five consecutive years (2016-2020).

     <strong>Talk Title: </strong>"AI Doctor and Smart Medical Imaging with Deep Learning" <br/><br/>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> Deep leaning becomes one of the most active areas of research in computer vision, pattern recognition, and medical imaging fields, because “learning from examples or data” is crucial to handling a large amount of data (“big data”) coming from imaging systems. I invented ones of the earliest deep-learning models for image processing, semantic segmentation, object enhancement, and classification of patterns in medical imaging. My group has been actively studying on deep learning in medical imaging in the past 25 years. In this talk, AI-aided diagnosis and smart medical imaging with deep learning are introduced, including 1) computer-aided diagnosis for lung cancer in CT, 2) distinction between benign and malignant lung nodules in CT, 3) polyp detection and classification in CT colonography, 4) separation of bones from soft tissue in chest radiographs, and 5) radiation dose reduction in CT and mammography.<br/><br/>

<strong>Talk Title: </strong>"link prediction on dynamic social networks" <br/><br/>
    <strong>Abstract:</strong>Link prediction is the process of detecting new or missing links in any network. This work focuses on link prediction in dynamic networks. One of the major challenges of the link prediction problem is to achieve high accuracy. One of the well-known methods for link prediction is the similarity- based method, which uses similarity-based score. The three widely used similarity-based indices are Local (L), Global (G), and Quasi-local (Q) for calculating similarity scores. In our proposed LGQ model, these wide categories of indices are used in different combinations( L, G, Q, LG, LQ, GQ, LGQ) for feature set generation that can be used with various machine learning techniques for link prediction. In local similarity indices, we have considered Common Neighbors (CN), Adamic/Adar Index (AA), Jaccard Coefficient (JC), and Preferential Attachment (PA). In global similarity indices, we have considered cos+, Average Commute Time (ACT), Shortest Path (SP), MFI (Matrix Forest Index), and in quasi-local indices, local path Index (LP), Path of Length 3 (L3). We have tested and validated our proposed model by conducting numerical simulations on six well-known dynamic network datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed LGQ model and its variations outperform several baseline algorithms in terms of AUPR, F1 score, Balanced accuracy score (BAC), and AUC.<br/><br/>

<b>Talk Title</b> - <font color="blue"><b>Dynamic Feature Selection using Rough Set Theory and Genetic Algorithm</b></font><br><br>
<b>Abstract:</b> Feature selection is an important task in dynamic environment where volume of dataset grows incrementally. In a dynamic environment, data come in regular interval of time based on which the importance of the features with respect to overall dataset is changed. To select the important set of features in a particular time, whole data may be applied in an efficient feature selection algorithm but this technique degrades the overall efficiency of the system as the same algorithm is applied all the time for the data, which are already examined. To overcome such demerit, newly generated group of data together with the previously selected features of old data are examined for obtaining the resultant features of the whole dataset. As a result, the efficiency and acceptability of the system increases. For this purpose, a group incremental feature selection method using rough set theory and genetic algorithm may be useful for selecting the optimal set of relevant features. Though the time complexity of genetic algorithm is a big issue in big data analytics, it does not affect such developed system as the method is applied after small to moderate volume of data are added into the system..

<b>Talk Title</b> - <font color="blue"><b>Nature inspired meta-heuristics for data clustering

</b></font><br><br>
<b>Abstract:</b>  The data clustering concept started with K-means algorithm which was initially reported by Lloyd of Bell Telephone laboratories in 1957. Since then several classical partitional clustering algorithms have been reported based on gradient descent approach. The 1995 kick started a new era in cluster analysis with the application of nature inspired meta-heuristics. Since the initial formulation nearly two decades have passed and researchers have developed numerous new algorithms in this field. This talk emphasizes on fundamentals and all major nature inspired meta-heuristic algorithms employed till date for partitional clustering. Further, key issues involve during formulation of various meta-heuristics as a clustering problem are to be highlighted. Potential application areas like image segmentation, Gene expression data analysis and localization in wireless sensor network are to be discussed

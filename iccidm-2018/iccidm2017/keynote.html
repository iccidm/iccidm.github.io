<b>Talk Title</b> - <font color="blue"><b>Design of Fuzzy Systems to improve the Gravitational Search Algorithm</b></font><br><br>
<b>Abstract:</b>  The issue of finding optimal values in optimization problems is an open challenge. On the other hand, there is not any search algorithm able to achieve the global optimum for all the functions. In the literature, various search methods have been proposed. Among search algorithms, the Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) is based on the law of gravity. GSA search performances can be improved by adjusting some suitable parameters. This task can be accomplished by means of intelligent techniques such as Fuzzy Logic, Genetic Algorithms, Particle Swarm Optimization and so on. A fascinating challenge is the design of Fuzzy Systems able to tune GSA parameters to improve the search performances at the same computational complexity.

<b>Talk Title</b> - <font color="blue"><b>  BioNLP and its Applications</b></font><br><br>
<b>Abstract:</b>  Biomedical text mining, generally referred to as BioNLP, is the application of data mining and machine learning techniques to extract useful information and knowledge in the biomedical as well as molecular biology literature. As the number of biological and biomedical publications are increasing exponential in PubMed and other indices/repositories, it is paramount to develop better natural language processing (NLP) tools and techniques, especially in conjunction with biological resources. This talk will provide an overview on the development of BioNLP and some recent advances and applications in this field with an emphasis on data mining and machine learning.

<b>Talk Title</b> - <font color="blue"><b>Swarm Intelligence: An Intelligent Way of Problem Solving</b></font><br><br>
<b>Abstract:</b> With the development of advanced technology, computational requirements have become high. Usually, for high computational needs, traditional algorithms become infeasible. In such case, some intelligent way of problem solving is required and swarm intelligence is one of them. Social creatures, like birds, fishes, ants, bees, termites etc, exhibit an intelligent social behavior during the search of food or protecting themselves from predators. This intelligent social behavior is usually, referred as Swarm Intelligence. Researchers have always been fascinated with swarm intelligence and applied this to develop some advanced intelligent algorithms to solve the problems where either traditional approaches fail or infeasible to use. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm (ABC), Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO) and Spider Monkey Optimization (SMO) are some of the algorithms based on the principles of swarm intelligence. The talk comprises some basic principles of swarm intelligence, and demonstrates how they are applied to develop intelligent algorithms, particularly, PSO and SMO.

<b>Talk Title</b> - <font color="blue"><b>Dynamic Feature Selection using Rough Set Theory and Genetic Algorithm</b></font><br><br>
<b>Abstract:</b> Feature selection is an important task in dynamic environment where volume of dataset grows incrementally. In a dynamic environment, data come in regular interval of time based on which the importance of the features with respect to overall dataset is changed. To select the important set of features in a particular time, whole data may be applied in an efficient feature selection algorithm but this technique degrades the overall efficiency of the system as the same algorithm is applied all the time for the data, which are already examined. To overcome such demerit, newly generated group of data together with the previously selected features of old data are examined for obtaining the resultant features of the whole dataset. As a result, the efficiency and acceptability of the system increases. For this purpose, a group incremental feature selection method using rough set theory and genetic algorithm may be useful for selecting the optimal set of relevant features. Though the time complexity of genetic algorithm is a big issue in big data analytics, it does not affect such developed system as the method is applied after small to moderate volume of data are added into the system..

<b>Abstract:</b> Machine learning has paid enormous attention for its potential applications in the field of bioinformatics, speech recognition, fraud detection, spam detection, computer vision and advertising networks which require wide variety of tasks including classification, regression and density estimation. In the recent years, machine learning has been successfully applied to address various challenges in wireless sensor networks too. Researchers have explored that neural networks, fuzzy logic, evolutionary algorithms, swarm intelligence, support vector machines and reinforcement learning are very useful machine learning techniques for solving the problems of sensor deployment, data aggregation, energy aware routing, anomaly detection, and localization. In this talk, a survey of machine learning applications in wireless sensor networks will be discussed. This will be followed by a presentation of particle swarm optimization based clustering and routing algorithms in wireless sensor networks..

<b>Talk Title</b> - <font color="blue"><b>Nature inspired meta-heuristics for data clustering

</b></font><br><br>
<b>Abstract:</b>  The data clustering concept started with K-means algorithm which was initially reported by Lloyd of Bell Telephone laboratories in 1957. Since then several classical partitional clustering algorithms have been reported based on gradient descent approach. The 1995 kick started a new era in cluster analysis with the application of nature inspired meta-heuristics. Since the initial formulation nearly two decades have passed and researchers have developed numerous new algorithms in this field. This talk emphasizes on fundamentals and all major nature inspired meta-heuristic algorithms employed till date for partitional clustering. Further, key issues involve during formulation of various meta-heuristics as a clustering problem are to be highlighted. Potential application areas like image segmentation, Gene expression data analysis and localization in wireless sensor network are to be discussed
